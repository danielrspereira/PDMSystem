## Introduction
Product Data Management (PDM) systems are crucial for efficient product design and management in engineering and manufacturing industries. 
They help organizations organize, control, and share product data and documents throughout the product development lifecycle. 
Solid Edge, a popular computer-aided design (CAD) software, is commonly used for product design and engineering tasks. 
Integrating a PDM system with Solid Edge can streamline workflows, enhance collaboration, and improve data management.

At the core of a PDM system are **items**. Items represent the fundamental building blocks of a product's design and bill of materials (BOM). 
In this simulation, items serve as the foundation for managing product data. Documents and other items can be attached to these items, allowing you to create a comprehensive bill of materials for your products.

This repository is designed to provide a simplified yet illustrative simulation of the core functionalities of a PDM system coupled with a Solid Edge Add-In. 
It serves as an educational resource and a starting point for those interested in understanding how PDM systems can be integrated into CAD environments like Solid Edge.

## Project Overview

### Key Features

- **PDM Simulation**: The repository includes a simulated PDM system that manages product data, revisions, and documents.
- **Solid Edge Add-In**: An Add-In for Solid Edge is provided, demonstrating how CAD software can interact with the PDM system.
